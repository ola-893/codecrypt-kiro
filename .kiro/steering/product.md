# Product Specification: CodeCrypt

## 1. Vision & Mission

**Vision:** To create a world where valuable, open-source code is never lost to time, transforming software archaeology into an interactive and insightful experience.

**Mission:** CodeCrypt is an autonomous AI agent that resurrects abandoned software projects. It breathes new life into dead code by intelligently analyzing its original intent, modernizing its foundations, and generating a rich, multi-sensory "Ghost Tour" that makes the history and structure of the code tangible.

## 2. Core Problem & Opportunity

**The Problem:** The "digital graveyard" of open-source software is vast, growing, and opaque. Countless GitHub repositories lie dormant, representing a massive loss of collective knowledge. For developers, understanding the history, architecture, and technical debt of these projects is a non-trivial barrier to modernization or learning.

**The Opportunity:** By combining deep code analysis with cutting-edge visualization and audio synthesis, we can transform the resurrection process from a tedious chore into an engaging and deeply insightful experience. This unlocks immense value by:
- **Saving developer time:** Automating the complex process of modernization.
- **Revealing hidden insights:** Visualizing code evolution, architectural patterns, and technical debt in a way that static analysis never could.
- **Creating a "Wow" Factor:** Making the complex, abstract process of code modernization dramatic, understandable, and memorable for demos and stakeholders.
- **Improving security:** Patching vulnerabilities in a transparent and verifiable way.

## 3. Target Audience & Personas

1.  **The Archaeologist (Primary):** A developer who needs to modernize an old library and wants to quickly understand its history, hot-spots, and architectural evolution to do so effectively.
2.  **The Team Lead/Architect:** A manager who needs to communicate the state of a legacy system to stakeholders. The visual and audio reports provide a powerful tool for demonstrating the impact of technical debt and the value of modernization.
3.  **The Organization:** A company that needs to validate that a resurrected legacy system is functionally identical to the original. The side-by-side Docker testing provides definitive proof.

## 4. Core Features & User Stories

### Feature 1: Automated Resurrection Pipeline
*As a developer, I want to provide a GitHub URL to CodeCrypt so that it can automatically clone, analyze, update, and modernize the entire repository.*

### Feature 2: 3D "Ghost Tour" Code Visualization
*As a developer, I want to explore a 3D city representing the codebase, where I can slide a timeline to watch the code evolve, see buildings (classes) grow and shrink, and identify hotspots of activity.*

### Feature 3: AI-Powered Audio Narration
*As a user, I want to hear a real-time AI narration of the resurrection process, explaining each step from dependency updates to test results, making the process engaging and easy to follow.*

### Feature 4: "Resurrection Symphony"
*As a user, I want to hear the "sound" of the codebase, where code quality metrics are translated into music, giving me an intuitive, auditory sense of the project's health before and after resurrection.*

### Feature 5: "Time Machine" Validation
*As an architect, I want to see the original and resurrected codebases run their test suites side-by-side in their respective environments (old vs. modern) to get absolute proof of functional equivalence and performance improvements.*

### Feature 6: Live Metrics Dashboard
*As a stakeholder, I want to watch a live dashboard with animated charts showing key metrics like vulnerabilities fixed, test coverage, and code complexity improving in real-time.*

### Feature 7: Hybrid AST + LLM Analysis
*As a developer, I want the system to combine the precision of AST analysis with the semantic understanding of an LLM to ensure modernization changes are not just syntactically correct, but also preserve the original developer's intent.*

## 5. Demo "Wow" Factors

The CodeCrypt demo is a multi-sensory experience designed to be unforgettable:
- **Visual:** A live, evolving 3D city of code, accompanied by a dashboard of animated charts.
- **Audio:** A confident AI narrator guides the audience through the process, while a "symphony" plays in the background, sonically representing the code's journey from chaos to harmony.
- **Proof:** A side-by-side "Time Machine" test run provides the undeniable climax, proving the resurrection was a success.
