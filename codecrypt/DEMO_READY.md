## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Your Presentation
1. **Open the site before you start** - Let it load completely
2. **Refresh if needed** - Ensures clean demo start
3. **Point to specific metrics** - Makes it tangible
4. **Emphasize automation** - This is the key value prop
5. **Show the charts** - Visual proof of improvement

### Handling Questions
- **"How long does it take?"** - Minutes instead of weeks
- **"Is it safe?"** - Yes, with rollback and validation
- **"What about breaking changes?"** - Hybrid analysis preserves intent
- **"Can I try it?"** - Yes, it's a VS Code extension

### If Something Goes Wrong
- Refresh the page (demo data reloads)
- Check browser console (should see "Loading demo data...")
- Try incognito mode (clears cache)
- Fallback: Show the documentation

## 🎭 Demo Mode Details

### How It Works
1. Detects production environment (Netlify)
2. Loads `/demo-data.json` automatically
3. Plays 30+ events at 1.5-second intervals
4. Simulates complete resurrection process
5. Shows all features in action

### What You'll See
- Purple "Demo Mode" status indicator
- Demo banner at top of dashboard
- Metrics updating every 1.5 seconds
- Charts animating with new data
- Transformation events appearing
- Final validation success

### Expected Behavior
- SSE connection errors are normal (no backend in production)
- AudioContext warning is normal (browser security)
- Demo data loads automatically
- All features work without backend
